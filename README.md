# ESS openEVR

ESS openEVR is a subset implementation of the MRF's Event Receiver. The project
is based in the mrf-openEVR firmware, released by MRF in GitHub.

The respository has been structured as an IP core which can be added from a
top project using VIVADO. The current development targets the picoZED carrier
board made by the Tallinn University of Technology as in-kind contribution to
the ESS.

**Still under heavy development.**

If you'd like to request a feature, contact any of the maintainers working for
the ESS.
